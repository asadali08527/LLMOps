# Monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs) in Production using LangKit, WhyLabs, and Other Tools

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs) in production using **LangKit**, **WhyLabs**, and additional tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Seldon Core**. These tools will help you observe, track, and analyze the performance, accuracy, and behavior of your models in production.

## 1. Import Libraries

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up a text generation pipeline with Hugging Face’s GPT-2 model.

```python
from transformers import pipeline  # Hugging Face's transformers for loading pre-trained LLM models
import langkit  # LangKit for monitoring LLMs in real-time
from langkit.monitoring import monitor_output  # Function for checking toxicity, bias, etc.
import whylabs  # WhyLabs for logging and tracking model performance

# WhyLabs client for monitoring logs
from whylabs import WhyLabsClient

# Load a pre-trained GPT-2 model using Hugging Face transformers
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
```

### Explanation:
1. **transformers.pipeline**: Loads a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's model zoo (in this case, GPT-2 for text generation).
2. **langkit**: LangKit helps monitor the output of LLMs, especially for identifying toxic content, bias, or any other undesirable text.
3. **WhyLabs**: WhyLabs allows you to log and track the performance of models over time, giving you insights into the model's behavior in production.

## 2. Monitor Generated Text with LangKit and WhyLabs

We generate text based on a prompt, monitor it for toxicity using LangKit, and log the results using WhyLabs.

```python
# Define a sample prompt for text generation
prompt = "This is a sample prompt for generating text."

# Generate text using GPT-2 model
generated_text = generator(prompt, max_length=50)[0]['generated_text']

# Monitor the generated text for toxicity using LangKit
monitor_result = monitor_output(generated_text)

# Display the generated text and its toxicity score
print(f"Generated Text: {generated_text}")
print(f"Toxicity Score: {monitor_result['toxicity']}")

# WhyLabs logging for tracking this result
client = WhyLabsClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")  # Replace with your actual WhyLabs API key
dataset = client.log({"toxicity": monitor_result['toxicity'], "text": generated_text})
```

### Explanation:
- **prompt**: A sample text input provided to the model for generating a response.
- **generator(prompt)**: GPT-2 generates text based on the prompt. The `max_length` parameter controls the length of the output.
- **monitor_output()**: This function from LangKit monitors the generated text for any toxic content or bias. It outputs a score indicating the level of toxicity.
- **WhyLabsClient.log()**: The result is sent to WhyLabs for logging and further analysis. This helps monitor how the model behaves over time.

## 3. Integrating Prometheus for Monitoring

Prometheus can be used to monitor performance metrics like inference time and the number of text generation requests.

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Summary, start_http_server  # Import Prometheus metrics
import time

# Start a Prometheus HTTP server to expose metrics
start_http_server(8000)

# Define Prometheus metrics
inference_time = Summary('llm_inference_time', 'Time spent generating text')
inference_requests = Counter('llm_inference_requests_total', 'Total number of text generation requests')

# Function to generate text and monitor performance with Prometheus
@inference_time.time()
def generate_text_with_metrics(prompt):
    inference_requests.inc()  # Increment the number of requests
    return generator(prompt, max_length=50)[0]['generated_text']

# Use the function and monitor
generated_text = generate_text_with_metrics("Monitor this text generation.")
print(f"Generated Text: {generated_text}")
```

### Explanation:
- **start_http_server(8000)**: Starts an HTTP server on port 8000 to expose Prometheus metrics.
- **Summary('llm_inference_time')**: A Prometheus summary metric that tracks the time spent generating text.
- **Counter('llm_inference_requests_total')**: A Prometheus counter that increments each time the model processes a text generation request.
- **@inference_time.time()**: Decorator that automatically times how long the function takes to run.

## 4. Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to monitor LLMs in production using:
1. **LangKit**: For checking toxicity, bias, and sentiment in generated text.
2. **WhyLabs**: For logging and tracking model performance over time.
3. **Prometheus**: For real-time metrics like inference time and number of requests.
4. **Grafana**: For visualizing these metrics on dashboards.

### Conclusion
Monitoring LLMs in production is crucial for ensuring their performance, reliability, and safety. By integrating tools like LangKit, WhyLabs, Prometheus, and Grafana, you can track important metrics, detect anomalies, and gain insights into your model’s behavior.

## 5. Sample Assignment
1. **Task 1**: Modify the GPT-2 model to handle multiple prompts and log metrics such as average inference time for each batch.
2. **Task 2**: Integrate another monitoring library (e.g., `seldon-core`) and use it alongside Prometheus to monitor not just LLM outputs but also input distribution changes over time.
3. **Task 3**: Create a Grafana dashboard to visualize key performance indicators like inference time, request count, and toxicity levels for the model.
